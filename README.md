# CCSDS Navigation Data Messages (NDM) Ontologies
A suite of ontologies for the [CCSDS](https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx) family of Navigation Data Messages

## Description

### Scope
The ontologies are intended to cover the content of/in the [CCSDS Navigation Data Messages](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/500x0g4.pdf), including the key concepts expressed and keywords used in the respective standard documents and in the described data messages. It specifically includes: the Orbit Conjunction Data Message, Orbit Mean-Elements Message, Orbit Ephemeris Message, Orbit Parameter Message.

### Purpose
- To provide a set of conceptual models / semantic models / ontologies / knowledge models for the CCSDS Navigation Data Messages, in order to provide globally-applicable formal representations of the content and semantics of the messages.
- To supplement currently used (as of 2024) formats of CSV, KVN, JSON, XML with additional formats of OWL, ORM, CLIF/CL, etc.
- To explore contemporary AI techniques, namely knowledge representation, semantic web technologies.
- To ideate and innovate in support of space data managemnet, and spaceflight safety and sustainability

### Status
- In progress, dependent on support
- As a personal project, support is needed (see links below)
