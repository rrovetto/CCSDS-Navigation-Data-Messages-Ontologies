# CCSDS Navigation Data Messages (NDM) Ontologies
A suite of ontologies for the [CCSDS](https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx) family of Navigation Data Messages

## Description

### Scope
The ontologies are intended to cover the content of/in the CCSDS Navigation Data Messages. This includes the keywords used in the respective CCSDS standard documents and the described data messages. It specifically includes each of the data messages: 
- the CCSDS Orbit Data Message
- the CCSDS Orbit Mean Element Message
- the CCSDS OEM
- the CCSDS OPM

### Purpose
- To provide a coontemporary ontology / conceptual data model / semantic data model for the family of CCSDS Navigation Data Messages
- To provide another format for the messages, minimally OWL, but also intending KIF, CLIF/CL, etc.
- To innovate for supporting space data managemnet, and spaceflight safety and sustainability

### Architecture

### Status
- In progress, dependent on support
- As a personal project, support is needed.
